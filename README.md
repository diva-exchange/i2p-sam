# I2P SAM

An I2P SAM library.

## How to Run Unit Tests

Unit tests can be executed using:

```
npm run test
```
Unit tests contain functional tests and will create some blocks within the local storage. The underlying network (like I2P) must be configured properly (the configuration is Work-In-Progress).


To lint the code, use
```
npm run lint
```
